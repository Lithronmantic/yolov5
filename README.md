This project is for real-time localisation and identification of common field pests, and we will publish our full code once the paper has been fully accepted.
The Pest 24 dataset is a publicly available dataset, and the download link provided by the original authors is https://pan.baidu.com/s/1F0pFu27-sHXwlsor_Aww9w, with the extraction code qtvi.
